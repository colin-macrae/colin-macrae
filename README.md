## 💬 About Me
I became interested in development in 2022.  After learning for a few weeks, I started to see it was a very good fit, and then decided to make it a full-on career change.  I'm now a full-stack developer with a couple of projects under my belt and more in the pipeline.  I continue to learn new technologies and techniques while improving my skills.  Outside of coding, I'm a bit obsessed with competitive road cycling 🚴🏻‍♂️🚴🏻‍♀️😁

Technologies: 
- The PERN stack:  PostgreSQL, Express, React.js, Node.js
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Chrome Dev Tools, Figma, Bootstrap, Slack

<!-- 🌱 I’m currently learning: MongoDB, Typescript (learning soon) -->
